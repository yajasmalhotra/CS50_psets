        <h1>A Beginner's Guide to Formula One</h1>

        <br>

        <h2 class="heading">What is Formula One?</h2>
        <p>Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of
        international single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale
        de l'Automobile (FIA) and owned by the Formula One Group. </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Who races in Formula One?</h2>
        <p>F1 is comprised of 10 teams (referred to as constructors), all of which
        consist of two drivers. The constructors that are currently participating
        in the F1 World Constructor's Championship consist of:
        <ul>
            <li>Mercedes</li>
            <li>Red Bull Honda</li>
            <li>Scuderia Ferrari</li>
            <li>McLaren Renault</li>
            <li>Renault</li>
            <li>Racing Point Mercedes</li>
            <li>Scuderia Alpha Tauri Honda</li>
            <li>Alpha Romeo Racing Ferrari</li>
            <li>Haas Ferrari</li>
            <li>Williams Mercedes</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">How are drivers chosen?</h2>
        <p>Like most sports, drivers are predominantly chosen based on attributes such
        as skill, talent, and experience. In modern F1, drivers are usually chosen based
        on their performance in feeder series, along with factors such as sponsors,
        adaptability to new conditions, and consistency.</p>

        <p>Several drivers are also part of driver development programs run by teams
        that groom young drivers specifically for a seat in an F1 car. The most famous driver
        development programs include:
        <ul>
            <li>Red Bull Junior Team</li>
            <li>Renault Sport Academy</li>
            <li>Mercedes Junior Team </li>
            <li>Ferrari Driver Academy</li>
        </ul> </p>
